    "A **_path_** is the general form of the name of a file or directory. It specifies a unique location in a file system. A path points to a file system location by following the directory tree hierarchy expressed in a string of characters in which path components, separated by a delimiting character, represent each directory. The delimiting character is most commonly the slash (\"/\"), the backslash character (\"\\\"), or colon (\":\").  \n",

    "* By contrast, a **_relative_** path starts from the current directory, avoiding the need to provide the full absolute path. In our case, the working directory is where the notebook is. A filename can be considered as a relative path based at the current working directory.    "
