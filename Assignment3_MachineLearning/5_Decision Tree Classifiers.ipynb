    "* The variable \"dataset\" stores the name of text file that you input and is passed as an argument of the function \"loadDataSet()\".  \n",
    "* The variable \"attributes\" stores the names of all features. The variable \"instances\" stores the values of all features in the training set. The variable \"labels\" stores the labels of all instances.  \n",
    "* The variable \"clf\" stores a decision tree model, and it can be trained with \"instances\" and \"labels\". Once the model is trained, it can be used to predict unseen instances.  We use a type of decision tree algorithm called CART (Classification and Regression Trees). \n",
    "* The variable \"n_foldCV\" stores the number of times of n-fold cross validation that you input.\n",

In that case,we need to encode categorical features into discrete values. This process is called feature encoding\n",
